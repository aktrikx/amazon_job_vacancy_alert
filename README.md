# amazon_job_vacancy_alert
This project is a Python script that automatically checks for job vacancies on the Amazon jobs website. If a job matching your specified location (e.g., "Remote location") is found, the script sends an alert email to the user. It also handles pop-ups, such as cookie consent and location permission prompts.
