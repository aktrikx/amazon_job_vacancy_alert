This project is a Python script that automatically checks for job vacancies on the Amazon Warehouse jobs website. If a job matching your specified location (e.g., "Remote location") is found, the script sends an alert email to the user. It also handles pop-ups, such as cookie consent and location permission prompts. The script is set up to run every 10 minutes, ensuring continuous monitoring for new job opportunities.
